# PROJECT
# 0x11. C - printf
C - printf project
This was a group project where we created a similar function to the printf function. My group comprised of two Mwansa Bwalya and I, Dangu Kazimiro.

## TASKS

## Write a function that produces output according to a format.
Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);

Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)

## Handle the following conversion specifiers:
d
i

## Handle the following custom conversion specifiers:
b: the unsigned int argument is converted to binary

## Handle the following conversion specifiers:
u
o
x
X

## Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible.

## Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
S : prints the string.

Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters)

## Handle the following conversion specifier: p

## Handle the following flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers:
+
space and #

## Handle the following length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers:
l
h
Conversion specifiers to handle: d, i, u, o, x, X

## Handle the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.

## Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.

## Handle the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

## Handle the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

## Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
r : prints the reversed string

## Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
R: prints the rot13'ed string

## All the above options work well together.

### Our thoughts
This project was highly collaborative, it involved researching on different taskks and sharing both our findings to come up with solutions to the tasks.
